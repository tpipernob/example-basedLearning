Van Gog and Rummel (2010) mention the use of Worked Examples and Modeling Examples. With the aim of expanding the vision of the effects of the use of examples in the learning process, Huang (2017) examined four different types of examples. In addition to the two already mentioned, Erroneous Worked Examples and Peer Modeling Examples were examined. Figure 1 shows a classification of the types of examples according to the pedagogical perspective of each one.
